Rules for Machination XML
-------------------------

Most of these rules are there to make sure that XML nodes are uniquely
identifiable, even when moved (relative to siblings). You should never
rely on position to find a node (i.e. don't go looking for
/path/child[1] or similar, look for /path/child[@id="id"]

1) Wherever multiple sibling elements *could* exist with the same tag,
   (i.e. the schema allows more than one element with this tag at this
   level), these *must* be identified with an "id" attribute. The
   identification must be unique at that level, but need not be unique
   elsewhere.

2) The "id" attribute in any element is reserved for the purpose above.

3) No mixed content. A node must have text content, data or element
   children. No combinations allowed.
