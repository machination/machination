Libraries
---------

- agroup_conf_inst groups encode XML snippets.
- These are not restricted to single XML elt branches.

  e.g. could contain instructions representing

  /profile/worker[packageman-1]/
  <package id="pkg1">
    <name>Package 1</name>
    <source>the source</source>
    etc.
  </package>

  /profile/worker[environment-1]/
  <var id="pkg1-license">value</var>

- such agroup_conf_inst groups can act as library items.

Dependencies
------------

- Deps between library items, need fields:

  source:      id of source lib item/group (not null, refs agroup)
  target:      id of target lib item/group (not null, refs agroup)
  op:	       requires,excludes,...	   (not null)
  
- also need to demark which nodes should be applied in order on the
  client, and thus need to be written in to the profile.

- add field for ordering

  ordered:   bool (not null)

- If dep is ordered, then the whole of the source or the target "work"
  is done first (depending on the sense of the dependency and whether
  something is being "added" or removed").

- Work ordering achieved by writing dep into the profile.

- If source and target work items should be interleaved (i.e. there
  are multiple top elements in the agroup, representing work which
  should be interleaved), then the source and/or target library items
  must be split into smaller components before adding deps.

  
Dependencies Take 2
-------------------

- perhaps a more general word would be "assertions".

- config instructions are also assertions? It's what you do if the
  assertion is not (yet) true that makes the difference.

  Invent some notation:

  assertion | remedial action
  $mp = machination abbreviated xpath (mxpath)
  $ap = mxpath to an attribute
  $ep = mxpath to an element

  throw exception can always be an action.

  + $ep exists ||
    - create_elt \$ep
    - add_libitem (default libitem)

  + $ep notexists ||
    - delete_elt \$ep
		
  + $ep hastext $text ||
    - set_text \$ep \$text
                
  + $ep hastextfrom @list ||
    - set_text \$ep $default_member
    - set_text \$ep user_choice()

  + $ep hastextfrom /regex/ ||
    - set_text \$ep $default_match
    - set_text \$ep user_choice()

  + $ap hasval $val ||
    - set_val \$ap \$val
