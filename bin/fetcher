"""A program to fetch machination bundles.

Machination workers can request this program to download a set of bundles, which
are sets of files.

The input XML determines which bundles are to be fetched and from where. A
configuration file (also XML) describes a set of sources. The output is XML
describing the success or failure at downloading each of the requested bundles.
It is expected that this program will fork a daemon if there are files to be
downloaded, returning failure for each of the bundles which are now in progress.
Once a download completes, this daemon will wake up the machination daemon which
is expected to rerun the fetcher, which now returns success.
