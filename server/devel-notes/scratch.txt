+ in assertion objects, "arg" should be allowed to be null.

+ when creating an object which belongs in an agroup, automatically
  determine the ag_ordinal.

+ add column to object_types to track whether the type belongs in an agroup

+ allow creation of objects with no parent and/or name=id as an option
  to create_obj. Allows objects like assertions to be auto named since
  these probably never need to exist outside their agroups.
