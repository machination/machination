  # wherever the hash link to the machination-server.crt is stored.
  #
  # On deb based systems, the package puts machination-server.crt into
  # /usr/share/ca-certificates/machination, inserts an entry into
  # /etc/ca-certificates.conf and then runs update-ca-certificates
  # which updates links in /etc/ssl/certs. That means you want a line
  # like:
  # SSLCACertificatePath /etc/ssl/certs
