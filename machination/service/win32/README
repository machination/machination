The following steps should only be run against this module when it is in its 'final location' after install as the path to the module will be cached in the service framework in Windows.

The service must be installed (once) before it can be started:
'python.exe machination-service.py install [--interactive]'

The module will also accept the following arguments instead of install:

start|stop|restart|remove

The service can also be started with the traditional 'net start' command.
